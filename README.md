# Casual Discussion Friday Live Feed

This is a bit of a pet project of mine that I've mostly been using to teach myself various things in the webdev world. I've come a long way since (roughly) September 2018, and I've only been getting better. You can find the landing page [here](https://friday.moe).

Please report any issues not already on the list here or you can [send me a message](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=ninjuh1124).

Current working branch: [React](https://github.com/ninjuh1124/fridaydotmoe/tree/React)
