# Casual Discussion Friday Live Feed

This is a bit of a pet project of mine that I've mostly been using to teach myself various things in the webdev world. I've come a long way since (roughly) September 2018, and I've only been getting better. You can find the landing page [here](https://friday.moe).

Please report any issues not already on the list here or you can [send me a message](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=ninjuh1124).

Live Branch: master  
Development Branch: [redux](https://github.com/ninjuh1124/fridaydotmoe/tree/dev)

## Known issues:

* ~~Some~~ A lot of comment faces are missing. See [here](https://pastebin.com/7EzdjC2d)
* Specific markdown syntax is not parsed: superscript
* Only edits done through the site will be recorded. Will not be refreshed.
* Nginx configuration doesn't like mobile networks. PM me if you know Nginx.

## "Future" Plans:

* Proper error handling
* Inline media embedding (Youtube, Twitter, etc)
* Sleeker comment face handling (static, animated, on-hover)
* Reconfigure Nginx (seriously, PM me. The documentation might be the driest read in existence)
