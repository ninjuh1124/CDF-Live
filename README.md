# Casual Discussion Friday Live Feed

Casual Discussion Friday is a weekly thread on Reddit's [/r/anime](https://reddit.com/r/anime). Most of us stay there all week, even after the thread is unstickied, and at some point I got fed up with both refreshing the page to get new comments, and somehow ending up with 15 tabs of CDF threads open. So knowing absolutely nothing of web development, and only a little bit of javascript, I wrote this horrible-looking site. One tab, automatically updates with new comments as they come in, clean UI, and ~~excellent~~ ~~competently written~~ good enough backend support.

***

## Known issues:

* ~~Some~~ A lot of comment faces are missing
* Specific markdown syntax is not parsed: superscript
* No easy way of listening for comment edits

##"Future" Plans:

* Better backend support
* Better error handling
